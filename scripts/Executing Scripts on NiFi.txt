Let me explain the relationship between different Python environments and NiFi:

## Poetry Environment vs System Python

When you create a Poetry-managed project, it creates an isolated virtual environment specifically for that project. This environment:
- Has its own Python interpreter
- Contains only the packages you've specified in pyproject.toml
- Works when you run scripts within the project context

## NiFi's Python Access

When NiFi's ExecuteStreamCommand runs a Python script, it:
- Uses the system Python interpreter specified in the Command Path
- Cannot automatically access your Poetry virtual environment
- Only has access to packages installed in the system Python environment

## Solutions

You have two options to make your script work in NiFi:

1. **Install Required Packages in System Python**:
- Install pandas directly to the system Python interpreter that NiFi uses
- This is why you needed to install pandas for the `/usr/local/bin/python3` interpreter

2. **Use Poetry's Environment**:
- Point NiFi to use the Python interpreter from your Poetry environment
- Find your Poetry environment's Python path using:
```bash
poetry env info --path
```
- Update the Command Path in NiFi to use this interpreter path

The second approach is more maintainable as it uses your project's managed dependencies, but requires proper configuration of paths in NiFi.
