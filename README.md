# EMG Signal Data Pipeline
## Objective: 
Build a scalable data pipeline to process, analyze, and visualize real-time EMG signals. This can demonstrate handling large, continuous data streams and extracting actionable insights.

## Steps to Build the Project:
### 1. Simulate or Collect EMG Signals:

Use existing EMG signal data from the Mio band or simulate EMG signals in Python if access is limited.
Format the data to include time-series values for 8 channels, labeled with timestamps.
### 2. Stream the Data:

Use Apache Kafka to stream the continuous EMG signals into a data pipeline. Kafka is ideal for real-time applications.
Alternatively, you can use Apache NiFi for ease of use in building a streaming pipeline.
### 3. Ingest and Store Data:

Store raw data in a data lake (e.g., Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage) for long-term storage and batch processing.
For structured data analysis, save processed data into a Snowflake database or a SQL-based database.
### 4. Process Data (ETL):

Use PySpark or Python (Pandas) for real-time data processing, including:
Filtering out noise or artifacts in the EMG signals.
Extracting key metrics like muscle activation patterns, frequency domain features, or signal amplitude trends.
Transform and prepare the data for machine learning or statistical analysis.
### 5. Analyze Data:

Develop algorithms to detect patterns, such as specific gestures or anomalies in muscle activity.
Use ML models or rule-based systems to classify muscle movements or detect anomalies in signal patterns.
### 6. Visualize Insights:

Build real-time dashboards with Tableau or Power BI to show EMG signal trends, channel activation, and classification results.
Alternatively, use Python libraries like Plotly or Matplotlib.
### 7. Implement CI/CD:

Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or Jenkins for deploying updates to the pipeline and machine learning models.
### 8. Deploy on Cloud:

Deploy the pipeline on AWS EC2 or Google Cloud VM for scalability and integration with cloud-native tools.
